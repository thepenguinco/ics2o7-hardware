				<h2> Eric Li </h2>
					<p class="spacing"> Hey there! I&rsquo;m a 14 year old penguin and I like sliding around on icebergs! I do all
					sorts of random computer programming, server administration, web design and security. You can find me in
					the South Pole! Mail me a letter at 143 Igloo Island.  I do all the computer-related parts for this team 
					including the website, the video and much more!
					</p>
				<h2> Jeremy Leung </h2>
					<p class="spacing"> Hey kids! Jeremy here. I&rsquo;m a 14-year old who likes eating children for breakfast!
					Just kidding. I eat them for lunch. Hobbies of mine include playing table tennis, playing PC games, and
					masticating food! And no, masticating is not an inappropriate word. You can often find me in Toronto,
					Ontario, if	you search hard. I'm the photo taker, website designer, storywriter and documenter for Team
					9.</p>
				<h2> Panya Tang </h2>
					<p class="spacing"> Hi! I&rsquo;m Panya and I&rsquo;m 14 years old. I like to eat, sleep and well... sleep. (You can
					never get enough sleep). I like to play sports, such as fencing and volleyball. In addition, I have won
					first place for being the #1 procrastinator. I help everyone and take photos! I also do the story writing!</p>
				<h2> Patrick Li </h2>
					<p class="spacing"> Hey! I&rsquo;m Patrick, and I&rsquo;m a starfish. My best friend is a sponge and I live under a
					rock. In my spare time, I like to build computers and play sports such as volleyball. I am in charge of
					the hardware portion of this project. I need to some funds to build a PC of my own, so please feel free
					to donate to me! You can find me at the Krusty Krab. I do the hardware portion of this project.</p>
