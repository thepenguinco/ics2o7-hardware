			<h1><u>Crime at Mrs. Kerrat&rsquo;s Abode</u></h1>
			<!--Removed Jeremy's Notes-->
			<p class="story">On the twelfth day of the twelfth month of 2014, Mrs. Kerrat, a prestigious but cordial
			businesscarrot could not have been happier to arrive home to the warmth of her garden patch. Exhausted from a long day
			at the office, Mrs. Kerrat was ecstatic to finally be able to have some free time on her computer, even though
			it was midnight already. You see, Mrs. Kerrat was no ordinary carrot; she was one of the classiest lawyers of
			Carronto. She fought diligently each day for each of her clients to secure the win for the case, and never
			accepted defeat.</p>

			<p class="story">The stunning vegetable threw her briefcase on the sofa and plopped down on her chair. Realizing
			her operating system failed to boot after numerous attempts, Mrs. Kerrat became concerned and decided to call the
			4 &ldquo;Bentectives&rdquo;, a group of bunny detectives who specialize in computer troubleshooting to come in and fix her system unit.</p>
			<p class="story">After receiving a call at their office, the Bentectives hopped their way to Mrs. Kerrat&rsquo;s garden
			patch. Following the inspection of the outer shell of the system unit, the computer case, the Bentectives came to an agreement that
			something must have happened to the inside of the system unit, concluding that somebody or something tampered with
			her computer. Mrs. Kerrat was shocked; who would do something like that to her? A former enemy of a case? A
			former client? Fear made its way into her miniature carrot brain.</p>
			<p class="story">Limbo-ing underneath the yellow police tape that surrounded her computer, Mrs. Kerrat cringed as
			the Bentectives took apart her beloved system unit.</p>
			<p class="story">After all the pieces were out, the Bentectives carefully examined each of the parts, including
			the RAM, CD ROM, the CPU, the power supply, the motherboard and the hard drive, for clues such as fingerprints. Unfortunately, they 					    did so without success. There was something suspicious about the system unit, but the Bentectives could not put their fingers on it. The Bentectives checked if the power supply cables were connected correctly to the motherboard. Some of the connectors may have been connected incorrectly, which might not have provided power to some of the components which would cause the system unit not to work. However, that was not the problem. They also checked if the data cables from the hard drive was correctly connected to the power supply. Another factor they thought may have caused the error was that the power button module was not connected correctly to the motherboard, which would have caused the click from the power button to not be registered by the computer. However, it was completely connected. When the Bentectives tested the RAM in another system unit, there seemed to be no problem. Next, they tested the CPU in another system unit, and passed every CPU benchmark and stress test thrown at it. The CPU was also tested together with the RAM from her system unit to check if the CPU could access it. The power supply was tested on a multimeter, and delivered its 160 watts with ease. They tested the motherboard by just installing it in another system unit. It ran fine and worked without an issue. Lastly, they tested the hard drive, which was put into another system unit. The information was perfectly preserved on the drive, and the drive was readable and writable. 
			Discouraged from the lack of finding anything that could lead them to the culprit, the Bentectives reassembled
			the system unit. </p>
			<p class="story">But wait! After the Bentectives reassembled the system unit, Beneric, one of the four 
			Bentectives, felt a slimy liquid on the bottom of the unit. Baffled, he raised his hand to his nose and sniffed
			the substance. &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; he thought as he made a disgusted face because of the putrid smell.</p>
			<img class="center" src="media/ericfacee.jpg" alt="Picture of Eric's disgusted face" height="25%" width="25%">
			<p class="story">At that moment, Beneric spotted a large bone half-buried in the corner of the room.</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Mrs. Kerrat, do you happen to have a dog?&rdquo; Beneric asked.</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Why yes; his name is Mr. Barkin&rsquo;, &rdquo; Mrs. Kerrat said.
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Well then I think we have a guilty party, &rdquo; Beneric said.</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Hmm? What are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Benjeremy, another one of the four Bentectives.</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;You see this disgusting slobber on my hand? I realized it&rsquo;s been on most of the hardware 
			we’ve inspected!” said Beneric. &ldquo;If you turn on the computer while it&rsquo;s soaked, the system unit will fail to operate.”</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Very educational,&rdquo; said Benpanya.</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;So it was the dog’s fault?&rdquo; asked Benpatrick.</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Oh my gosh! Mr. Barkin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Mrs. Kerrat.</p>
			<p class="story">When the Bentectives cleaned up the slobber, they test booted the system unit, and it finally booted correctly. However, it was very slow.</p>
			<p class="story">Benjeremy had a suggestion, &ldquo;I think the problem is the high hardware demands of Windows. To make your system unit run faster, you should install Lubuntu, a light weight OS based off of Ubuntu, a type of Linux Operating System!&rdquo;</p>	
			<p class="story">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know how to do that!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Kerrat.</p>
			<p class="story">&ldquo;We can do that for you! All you need to do is format a USB drive into a bootable USB drive. Then we will install Lubuntu onto the USB drive. After, we will boot your system unit from the USB drive&rdquo;, explained Benpatrick.</p>		
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Hey look, I have one here!&rdquo; exclaimed Beneric. </p>  
			<p class="story">&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s install it on her system unit! All we need to do is back up her data, and then install it on the hard drive. Then, we&rsquo;ll be done!&rdquo; said Benpanya.</p>
			<p class="story">After they finished installing Lubuntu, Mrs. Kerrat&rsquo;s system unit was running like new. Mrs. Kerrat thanked the Bentectives, and the Bentectives were off to save another system unit in crisis! </p>
